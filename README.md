## 🚀 Project Overview

Globblog is a full-featured blog application built with the MERN stack, following atomic design principles for a structured frontend. Initially developed as a showcase project, it is now near-professional grade with potential for public launch.

**Source Code:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vishnudt2004/globblog)

## 🔧 Known Issues & Future Improvements

### 📝 Write a Blog

- Blogs with high indentation may not display well on mobile screens.
- Resizing images in the rich-text editor can cause stretching issues on smaller screens.

### ⚙️ Development

- The project structure follows personal conventions, which may be hard for others to understand.

### 🎨 UI & UX

- **Footer:** Social media links are placeholders, not real links.
- **Home & Search:** Latest blogs persist on navigation, but Trending & Search results do not (for real-time accuracy).
- **Write Page:** Limited blog tags/keywords; custom tags are not allowed.

## ✨ Potential Enhancements

- **SEO Optimization:** Needs proper metadata for better search engine visibility.
- **Image Optimization:** No image compression yet, which affects loading speed.
- **Code Refactoring:** Some components can be optimized for better maintainability.
- **Performance Tweaks:** Initial page load time can be improved by reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- **Likes & Comment System:** Implement a like feature and enhance the comment system with edit/delete functionality.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (Atomic Design), Redux, QuillJS (Rich Text Editor)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication, Google OAuth2.0
- **Deployment:**
  - **Frontend:** GitHub + Vercel
  - **Backend:** GitHub + Render
  - **Database:** MongoDB Atlas

## 🗂 Configuration Files

- **Frontend:**
  - [`/src/styles/config.css`](frontend/src/styles/config.css) – UI-related variables and theme settings.
  - [`/src/config/config.js`](frontend/src/config/config.js) – App-level constants and UI config toggles.
- **Backend:**
  - [`/src/config/config.js`](backend/src/config/config.js) – Environment-based constants and app-wide configurations (e.g., base URLs, SMTP config references).

## 📌 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16)
- MongoDB
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vishnudt2004/globblog.git
   cd globblog
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```sh
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   cd ../backend && npm run dev  # or npm run prod
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory (`frontend/.env`) and add:

   ```sh
   VITE_ENV=development/production
   VITE_CLIENT_URL=your_client_url
   VITE_SERVER_URL=your_server_url
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory (`backend/src/config/.env`) and add:

   ```sh
   NODE_ENV=development/production
   PORT=your_port_number
   CLIENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173
   SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
   DB_CONNECTION=your_mongodb_url
   SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
   SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
   SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
   SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
   SMTP_FROM=your_email_address
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   INITIAL_SEED=true/false
   INITIAL_SEED_ACTION=WipeUsers/WipeBlogs/SeedUsers/SeedBlogs/WipeAndSeedAll
   ```

5. Optional – HTTPS Setup for Local Development (This setup helps test features that require a secure context (e.g., Google OAuth 2.0))

- Frontend

  - Update any URLs (e.g., `VITE_CLIENT_URL`, `SERVER_URL`) in both `.env` and `config.js` to start with `https://` instead of `http://`.
  - In vite.config.js, uncomment the following in the server config:
    ```js
    server: {
    https: true,
    // ...other options
    }
    ```

- Backend:

  - Update all URLs (e.g., `CLIENT_URL`, `SERVER_URL`) in both `.env` and `config.js` to start with `https://` instead of `http://`.
  - In `server.js`, enable the local HTTPS server:
    ```js
    const server = devHttpsServer(app); // Uncomment this line
    ```

- Self-Signed SSL Certificate (for HTTPS in Development) (If using HTTPS in development, generate a self-signed SSL certificate:)

  ```sh
  mkdir certs && cd certs
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.cert -days 365 -nodes
  ```

  Place the `server.key` and `server.cert` files inside a `certs/` folder located in the root directories of both the /frontend and /backend.
  Your browser may warn you about unsafe certificates—proceed manually or configure the browser to trust your certificate for local dev.

## 📌 Usage

- Register or log in to create and manage blogs.
- Browse latest & trending blogs or search specific blogs.
- Manage user profile and view published blogs.
